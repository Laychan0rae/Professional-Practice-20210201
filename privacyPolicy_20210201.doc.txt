**Privacy Principles Checklist** 


1.Principle 6** = Access to personal information, this principle states that any individual has the ability/right to request their own personal information. Although an agency does have the right to refuse access to the individual’s information in certain cases. For example. 
 -if the re-realise of their information could endanger themselves
 1b. if it could prevent the detection or could stop an investigation of     criminal offences.
-or it could involve someone else or breach someone else’s privacy 
How can someone Access their personal information?  
An agency/website it would be beneficial for them to have a quick and easy way for users/individuals to access their personal files i.e., allowing them to create a profile/account, where they could access and or request a change of their personal information on the home website.
What if they cannot find a way to access the information? 
Have a phone number that an individual can call to request a change of information, and the agency then can note a request of change into the system and email them back once the change has been made or if it has been unsuccessful.  


2. Principal 7= following Principle 6, this principle involves the correction of personal information. Meaning that any one individual has the right to file a request of change or correction of their personal information. However, the agency is not required to correct the information and can at the request of the individual, attach a statement regarding their request of correction on the disputed incorrect information. The agency is required to give a reason for the refusal of correction of information and is required to, at the request, attach the statement of correction to the information that the individual says is incorrect.    
-How could you set out that the individual gets notification of the acceptance or denial of the request?
I would set up an automatic response system that sends out an email or TXT message to the individual to show them that the request has been received and that if it has been accepted or not. If it has been denied will send a link and reference number so that you can visit and see why it has been denied and what statement of correction has been attached  
-How could someone change their information?
 Create a page based on the agency that allows users to input the disputed incorrect information that will then be revised and either accepted or denied based on the reason it was collected and if correction is needed. 

3. Principal 8= Accuracy, principle 8 is relatively like principle 7 in the way it deals with the accuracy of the information that you hold. It is up to the website or agency to be holding the correct information that they have; this does not affect information that was correct at the time it was collected. They also have the responsibility to keep the information correct, if it is being held for future purposes, and to make sure that the information that they are collecting is remanding relevant to the reason it is being collected and used.
-How would an agency make sure the information collected is still within the reason of collection?
I would set up a checklist that is used to make sure that the information is correct and is not misleading or moving away from the original purpose it was collected. This checklist would be setup around the reason for collection due to the ever changing of the reason for collection.
-How can the agencies make sure that the information collected is correct?
This could be done by using a code that allows the agency to safely input the information into, and it will scan and record the information and base it back to the checklist that is provided. 

4. Principal 10= agencies most not use personal information other than for the use it was collected for. This means that an agency cannot collect say date of birth to create a chart to show how many people were born in this month, to then use it to create a profile for them within their website or for any other use.
However, there are some instances where they are non-compliant on some grounds which are.
-The individual has authorized his information to be used in another way.  
-The other use of their information does connect to the reason of collection.
Also, the information that the website/agency collected can be used in certain instances such as
- It is needed to uphold the law or conduct of proceedings before court tribunal.
- The information in use does not have identifiers of the individual or it is to be used for statistics or research.
- And if the information was taken from a public record or a public available publication.
How could an agency make sure that the information collected is still within the reason it is collected?
For the agency to uphold this they would have to have a set out list of rules and regulations that regard the collection of information that they would reference back to when collecting for instance the list would question. 
 -Is this relevant to the reason of collection?
 -Will this information help us regarding the collection purpose?
 -If another reason of collection is included, does the individual   providing the information give authorization for this use?

-How could an agency avoid an individual of the agency using the information incorrectly?
Allow members of the agency to upload a copy of the information provided into a site that will allow it to be reviewed by other qualified members of the agency to review it and confirm if it is lawful or misuse of information. 


5. Principal 9= This principle regards that the agency cannot hold the information for longer than is required. There also is no minimum required time for you to depose of the information so as soon as you are finished with the information discard it immediately.
Once the agency is done with the information it is responsible for the way it is disposed of be that returned, destroyed or transferred. But there are ways that these should be carried out.
For a company to follow this principle they would have to have a retention policy draw up that outlines how and why they discarded of the information. Also, they would have to have some way to see what has been discarded and if done incorrectly how they can get it back and discard it properly. 


How could an agency go about making sure the discarding of information is done correctly?
-Have someone within the agency whose specific job is to uphold and make sure the disposing of information is carried out properly, the individual would be responsible for creating the retention policy for the agency and would make sure it is carried out.
  What should an agency’s retention policy outline?
-when making the retention policy you would have to ask themselves, should any personal information given be retained at all? And if so, why should it be retained?
-What is the minimum amount of time can they hold that information for
-how will their information be disposed of if so? Will it be destroyed if so how? If transferred where too?
